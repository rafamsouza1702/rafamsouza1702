## 🌩️ Aspiring Cloud Solution Architect | Tech Lead @ SumUp

🎯 I'm a **Tech Lead ** transitioning into a full-fledged **Cloud Solution Architect**.  
At the moment, I lead Contact Center platform efforts across **the globe**, delivering global-scale solutions in high-availability environments.

With over **10 years of experience**, I’m combining deep technical leadership with hands-on cloud architecture — currently focused on **AWS**, **serverless**, **event-driven systems**, and **voice platforms like Amazon Connect and Lex**.

## ☁️ Cloud Skills & Tools

- **AWS Core Services**: EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, Lambda, SQS, SNS, DynamoDB, RDS, API Gateway, Route 53  
- **Serverless Architectures**: Lambda, Step Functions, EventBridge, SQS  
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS SAM, CloudFormation, Terraform (WIP)  
- **Python Automation**: boto3, FastAPI, script orchestration  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, CodePipeline (in progress)  
- **Monitoring & Security**: CloudWatch Logs, X-Ray, IAM best practices

## 🎧 Contact Center Expertise

Over the years, I’ve built, led and integrated **contact center** solutions at global scale, working with multiple platforms:

| Platform          | Experience Highlights |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Genesys Cloud** | Voice/IVR flows, APIs, agent setup, architecture and expansion |
| **Five9**         | Routing logic, IVR design, CRM integrations, reporting |
| **Vonage**        | Programmable Voice, number provisioning, API integrations |
| **Amazon Connect** _(hands-on)_ | Contact flows, Lex bots, Lambda integrations, S3 call storage, callback APIs |

I'm currently building a public portfolio showcasing real-world **Amazon Connect** projects:  
👉 IVR flows, Lex bots, Lambda-backed integrations, serverless scheduling APIs and more.
